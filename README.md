# p5-playground

A repository for building different small projects using p5.js.

Most of the projects are runnable straight out of the box.

But in order to run projects require images, sounds, and/or video you need to host a local server:

**Option 1 (requires Python 3.x):**

- type the following in the root directory of the repo

```
python -m http.server
```

- open [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)

**Option 2 (requires Node.js):**

- install http-server globally through the terminal/command prompt (might need admin rights)

```
npm install -g http-server
```

- type the following in the root directory of the repo

```
http-server
```

- open [http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html)
